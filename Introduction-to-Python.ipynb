    "- Lists can shrink and grow dynamically\n",
    "\n",

    "### What type of Python error message do you get?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is natural to get error messages when you are coding, especially for beginners. Reading the error messages generated by Python can be very helpful in identifying the problem in your code syntax. Here are some common types of error messages in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Attribute Error__\n",
    "- You are calling a method on the wrong type of object.\n",
    "\n",
    "__SyntaxError__\n",
    "- You have forgotten the quotation marks (“ ”) around a string.\n",
    "- You have forgotten to put a colon (:) at the end of a def/if/for line - You have different numbers of open and close brackets\n",
    "\n",
    "__TypeError__\n",
    "- You are trying to use an operator on wrong type of object\n",
    "- You have used non-integer numbers when slicing a list\n",
    "- An object you expect to have a value is actually None\n",
    "- You have called a method or function with the wrong number or type of arguments (input to a function).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Indentation Error__\n",
    "- You have used a mixture of tabs and spaces\n",
    "- You have not indented all lines in a block equally\n",
    "- You have not indented when Python expects you to\n",
    "\n",
    "__NameError__\n",
    "- You have forgotten to define a variable\n",
    "- You have misspelt a variable, function or method name\n",
    "- You have forgotten to import a module or a package\n",
    "- Your code uses a variable outside the scope (e.g. within the function) where it is defined\n",
    "- Your code calls a function before it has been defined\n",
    "- You are trying to print a single word and have forgotten the quotation marks\n",
    "\n",
    "__IOError__\n",
    "- You are trying to open a file that doesn’t exist - You are in the wrong directory\n",
    "\n",
    "__IndexError__\n",
    "- The index that you have given to a sequence is out of range \n",
    "\n",
    "__Key Error__\n",
    "- You are trying to look up a key that does not exist in a dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "__ValueError__\n",
    "- You are trying to perform numerical operations on arrays with different dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "- You have given an argument with the right type but inappropriate value to a function or to an operation\n",
    "\n"
